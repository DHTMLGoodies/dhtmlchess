3. Nc3 Nf6

strength of the this move, which today is routine} 
4..Be7
5. Nf3 Nbd7
6. Rc1 O-O
7. e3 b6 {In order to develop the Queen Bishop on
Bb7. This was the most popular way of defending the
Queen's gambit declined at the time.}
8. cxd5 {Depriving Black of the opportunity to play
dxc4 when the diagonal b7-g2 would be open for his
Queen Bishop.} 8...exd5 ({The classical
continuation more common today is} 8..Nf6xd5 {which 
accomplishes some exchanging after} 9. Bxe7, Qxe7 10.
Nxd5, e6xd5)
9. Bd3 Bb7
10. O-O c5 {A strategical necessity. Otherwise, this
pawn will remain backward and vulnerable to White's
Rook on the half open Queen Bishop file.}
11. Re1 {Whatever the purpose of this move, it turns
out to be a loss of time, for the Rook later goes
back to f1.} 
11...c4 {This move releases the
tension in the center in order to commence a queen
side attack. White will counter this by an attack on
the other wing.}
12. Bb1 a6 {In order to play b5. Black's plan is to
advance his queen side pawns with the ultimate aim of
obtaining a passed pawn.}
13. Ne5 {The knight is here aggressively posted in the
neighborhood of Black's King.} 13...b5
14. f4 {This move furthers White's attack in several
ways.  Should Black ever play Nxe5, White will
recapture with the Bishop Pawn and open his King
Bishop file. The White's King Bishop Pawn may later
in the game advance to f5, threatening to break up
Black's kingside by f6. White's King Rook now can
advance to Black's kingside by Rf1-Rf3 and Rg3 or
Rh3.} 14...Re8 {To be able to bring his Queen Knight
to Nf8, where it is an excellent defensive piece.}
15. Qf3 {Bringing the Queen to the attack.} 15...Nf8
16. Ne2 {Transferring the Knight to the kingside.}
16...Ne4 $1 {Black blocks the White King Bishop
diagonal and exchanges off his King Bishop. Each 
exchange favors Black, for they lessen the vigor of a
kingside attack.  Queen side attacks, by contrast,
are concerned with obtaining a passed pawn, which is
even more advantageous in the end game then the 
middle game.}
17. Bxe7 {Black was threatening to win a piece with
f6} 17...Rxe7
18. Bxe4 {White is not happy to give up his King
Bishop, but there is no way to drive away Black's
Knight at e4, and as long as it remains there it is 
more effective than the Bishop, whose diagonal itblocks.} 
 18...dxe4
19. Qg3 {Black is not the only one who has gained
something from these exchanges. Now that Black's
Queen Bishop Pawn no longer has the support of a
Queen Pawn, he is much less free to advance his queen
side pawns, and his attack on the queen side is thus
slowed.  White's backward King Pawn, which previously
was indirectly under  pressure by Black's King Rook,
now has shelter behind Black's Pawn at the latter
e4.} 19...f6 {This slightly weakens Black's
kingside, but it is worth it to prevent White's King
Bishop Pawn from ever advancing to f6.}
20. Ng4 {Threatening 21. Nxf6+.} 20...Kh8
21. f5 {Cramping Black's kingside and vacating his f4
which can now be occupied by a Rook or a Knight.} 
21...Qd7
22. Rf1 {See note at move 11.} 22...Rd8 {Preparing
Qd6 to defend his f6 pawn a second time.}
23. Rf4 {White is embarking upon a plan to attack
Black's isolated King Pawn , and tie up Black's
pieces to its defense.} 23...Qd6
24. Qh4 Rde8
25. Nc3 Bd5 {To be able to guard the King Pawn again
by Qc6.}
26. Nf2 Qc6
27. Rf1 {White must be careful now about removing any
pieces from the queen side, for Black can play b4,
followed by Qa4, menacing White's queen side pawns.}
 27...b4
28. Ne2 Qa4 ({If Black tries to advance his c Pawn with} 28..c3 {there follows} 29. bxc3, bxc3 30. Nd1, c2 31. Ndc3, Bc4 32. d5, Bxd5 33. Rc1

 defenseless against 37. Rh5 and Qh8} )
31. Nc1 {Guarding his Queen Rook Pawn. If he had done
this on move 
 twenty-nine, Black would have had the crushing reply
Qc7.} 31...c3 
 {Black gets a passed Pawn.}
32. b3 Qc6  {Both sides now have clear cut plans. 
Black will advance his 
 Queen Rook Pawn to a4, exchange pawns and bring a
Rook to a3  winning White's Queen Knight Pawn. White
will counter by advancing his King Knight Pawn to g5
and opening up his King Knight file.}
33. h3 {Making room for the Knight at h2.} 33...a5
34. Nh2 {White's attack looks slower than Blacks, but
White has a
 stroke of genius prepared.} 34...a4

 powerful.} )
38. Ng4 Bb3  ({At this moment neither Tarasch nor the
onlookers had any doubt that white was finished. In
the February 1971 issue of Chess Review, Frank
Rhoden relates that Mr. E.G. Taylor, a Hastings chess
 club member who actually witnessed the game, told him
that after Tarasch made his 38th move, "The
spectators began to drift away, thinking there was
nothing more to see." But now comes one of the most
dramatic surprises ever seen on a chessboard. With
hindsight, several annotators have advocated that
black play 38.. Rxb3, which sacrifices the exchange
for a pawn. Black would then have his Bishop 
available for the defense and obtain two dangerous
connected passed pawns. But 38...Rxb3 is no better
than the move played.}

White played a Muzio and followed it up with Nc3
instead of the usual Qxf3}
6... c6? {Black plans to
place his Queen on Qf6, so that after White plays Qxf3
he cannot at once follow this with Qxf4 because Black
will exchange queens. With the text move Black keeps
White's knight out of Nd5 where he may eventually
harass Black's Queen. However,  if 6..

on Black's d5 and f5. This procedure was originated
by Steinitz in one of the games of his match with
Blackburne in 1876. Later it became standard in many
variations of the Lopez. Also very good was first 0-0

of delaying castling when such a strategy was
playable In this way he kept open the option of 
castling on the queenside.}
7... 0-0
8. Ba4 {There is a good point to this seeming waste of
time. White plans to respond with Qe2 if Black should
play d5 guarding his king pawn and preventing the
exchange of queens. If Black should then play Bd7
White wants to have a retreat for his king bishop at
c2 so that Black cannot force its exchange with
Nd4.}
8... Nd7 {This would be a good move if Black planned
to follow it up with Nb6 and d5 advancing in the
center.  However Black played it with the idea of
continuing in this way; Nc5 Ne6 (The knight will be
loose on c5 after Black plays d5.) Ne7 and finally
d5. An awfully slow plan!  Black had two good
alternatives; 8...a6 followed by b5 and d5 (or Na5 
followed by c5 putting pressure on Whites d4 if White
plays Bb3 instead of of Bc2 and 8...d5 at once.

11.. Qh4 {This move is sometimes used as an example of
Lasker's well known skill in applying the
psychological element to chess. The objectively best
move here is 11..f6, which would open the king bishop 
file and allow Black to make use of his more active
pieces. However, Lasker feels that for this
particular opponent it will be psychologically more
difficult if he plays more aggressively and goes over
to the attack. The reason? Marshall was a player
who always strove for the initiative, and he was one
of the greatest attacking and combinative players of
all time. The defense was an uncomfortable and
unfamiliar role for him.}
