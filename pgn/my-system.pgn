1. e4 {Notes by Nimzowitsch except where noted.} e6 2. d4 d5 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. exd5 Nxd5 {Surrender of the center} 5. Nf3 c5 {To "kill" the Pawn. "Restraint" might have been effected by, say ...Be7, ...0-0, ...b6, ...Bb7.} 6. Nxd5 Qxd5 7. Be3 {It was to be able to make this move, which combines development and attack (the threat is dxc5 winning a Pawn), that  White exchanged Knights.}
cxd4 {Disappearance of tempo spells loss of time.} 8. Nxd4 a6 9. Be2 Qxg2 {Stealing a Pawn. The consequences are grievous.} 10. Bf3 Qg6 11. Qd2 e5 {The crisis. Black means to be rid of the unpleasant Knight, so that he may in some measure catch up in development.   } 12. O-O-O  exd4
13. Bxd4 {White's advantage in development is now too great.} Nc6 14. Bf6 { Travels by express. Any other Bishop move could have been answered by a development move, whereas now there is no time for this; Black must take.} Qxf6 15. Rhe1+ {Play in the King and Queen files at the same time. The danger of a breakthrough is great.} Be7 {or 15...Be6 16.Qd7 mate!} 16. Bxc6+ Kf8 {or 16...bxc6 17.Qd8 mate.} 17. Qd8+  Bxd8
