1. d4 {Good day Ladies and Gentleman. Today will be observing the main event in the modern chess history - Unification Match. The game will be commented by me, the first GM of Kalmykia - Ernesto Inarkiev} Nf6 2. c4 {Well, the main plan of the start is disclosed: Russian player moves Queen pawn first.} e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 {Catalon. One of the most obvious objections to the classical placement of the black } dxc4 5. Bg2 Bb4+ 6. Bd2 a5 {This position was  met before in rapid chess game between Bareev - Kramnik, Monaco 2005, when Bareev preferred  7.0-0,  and then  7…0-0 8.Nc3 Nc6 9.a3 Bc3 10.Bc3 Nd5 11.Bd2 b5 12.e4 Nb6. That position was equally good for both players and the game finished with the draw} 7. Qc2
Bxd2+ 8. Qxd2 c6 9. a4 b5 10. axb5 cxb5 11. Qg5 O-O 12. Qxb5 {All this was played by Grischuk - Moiseenko in Sochi 2006} Ba6 {Here is innovation. In mentioned game it was 12…Na6 which lead to the white dominance after 13.Qc4 Nb4 14.Qb3 e5 15.Ne5 Rb8 16.0-0 Qd4 17.Qc3.} 13.
Qa4 {13. Qa5 does not work  because of 3…Bb7 14.Qd8 Ra1 15.Qf8 (very bad 15.Qb6 Rb1 16. Kd2 c3) 15…Kf8 with compensation for the pawn sacrifice } Qb6 14. O-O Qxb2 15. Nbd2 Bb5 16. Nxc4 Bxa4 17. Nxb2 Bb5 18. Ne5 {We can line up the debut of the game. It's endspiel on the board and black have vague promotion pawn, but white have better development. Black need accuracy not to get into difficult position }
Ra7 {Good move. 18…Ra6 in worse because of 19.Nbd3 and black cannot finish development 19…Nbd7 20.Rfb1 and to 20…Ne5 white have  21.Nc5!} 19. Bf3 {Nobody pushes. White still keep initiative after 9.Nbc4 Nbd7 20.Na5 Ne5 21.fe Ng4  22.Rfb1, black have poorly placed pieces on the one had and no weakness on the other. So we cannot speak of white prevailing } Nbd7 {Black have finished development, wite have nothing so far. 20.Nc6 can be beaten by black 20…Bc6 21.Bc6 and black join the last unused piece to the battle 21…Rc8. Black have the order. } 20. Nec4 {Kramnik is trying to make struggle more difficult. There is 20.Nd7 in answer to 20…Bd7, with following Rb8 } Rb8 {Simple and strong. Now, in case of knight retreat from c4, there is Be2. Black keep the order. } 21. Rfb1 g5 {Great move. Three in one. Making pressure to e2 pawn, getting the territory and freeing the space} 22. e3 {22.Ne3 is interesting with idea of Nbc4. The knight is hopefully to be activated. I do not think it feels comfortable at b2} g4 {Bishop under the investigation. If one leaves diagonal h1-h8 black bishop acquires  c6, from which it defenses pawn and keeps the center. But if one moves to g2 - bishop is not able to be in game on the queen's side} 23. Bd1 Bc6 {Interesting 21…a4 but not clear where the pawn should be kept, it is under bishop's d1 strike at a4. For example: 21…a4 22.Na3 Bc6 23.Nbc4.} 24.
Rc1 {It's 17 moves to the control. This means Kramnik has 2 minutes per move. Tense rhythm. } Be4 25. Na4 {With threat Nc3 } Rb4 26. Nd6 {White are trying to push out the bishop, but black have  perfect square f3. 6.Nc5 Nc5 27.dc a4 (or 27…Bd5 28. Na5! Rb5 29.c6 Rba5 30.Ra5 Ra5 31.c7 Bb7) 28.Nd6 Bc6 29.Nc8! Rc7 30.Nb6= leads to the equalization } Bf3 27. Bxf3 {Guided by principle  continuation } gxf3 28. Nc8 {Knight is moved to c6 } Ra8 29. Ne7+ Kg7 {Interesting 29…Kf8 30.Nc6 Rb3 and if 31.Rb1, the answer 1…Rb1 32.Rb1 Ne4,  and black have strong group on king's side, white rook is locked to the right side to avoid mate threats }
30. Nc6 Rb3 {It's still dangerous 31.Rb1 because of  31…Rb1 32.Rb1 Ne4. 31.N?5 is interesting to gain attention of knight from e5 and then take f3} 31. Nc5 Rb5 {Maybe white need 32.Ra2.} 32. h3 {White have powerful knights, Kramnik does not change the situation, improving king's position. Black just need to take c5 and move Rc8 for stability} Nxc5 33. Rxc5 {Attack possibility is attractive 33…Rb2} Rb2 34. Rg5+ {After 34…Kf8 35.Rga5 Ra5 36.Na5 one has to play  37.Rf1} Kh6 35.
Rgxa5 {It's better to exchange rooks for black} Rxa5 36. Nxa5 Ne4 37. Rf1 Nd2 38. Rc1 Ne4 39. Rf1 f6 {Black have clear pawn compensation. White have more dangerous position. Taking important field at e5, white have no chance to attack f3 pawn} 40. Nc6 Nd2 {Time control is passed. Black have time to play but how to break this?}
41. Rd1 Ne4 42. Rf1 Kg6 43. Nd8 Rb6 44. Rc1 h5 45. Ra1 h4 46. gxh4 Kh5
47. Ra2 Kxh4 48. Kh2 Kh5 49. Rc2 Kh6 50. Ra2 Kg6 51. Rc2 Kf5 52. Ra2
Rb5 53. Nc6 Rb7 54. Ra5+ Kg6 55. Ra2 Kh5 56. d5 e5 57. Ra4 f5 {A big mistake. Black could be fixed at draw, for example by 57…Nf2 58.Kg3 e4 59.Kf2 Rb2 with perpetual check, cause f pawn will promote otherwise} 58. Nxe5
Rb2 59. Nd3 Rb7 {Probably Veselin was counting on 59…Rd2, white has 60.Rd4.} 60. Rd4 {White has decisive advantage} Rb6 61. d6 Nxd6 62. Kg3 Ne4+ 63. Kxf3 Kg5 64.
h4+ Kf6 65. Rd5 Nc3 66. Rd8 Rb1 67. Rf8+ Ke6 68. Nf4+ Ke5 69. Re8+ Kf6

cxd5 14. Qe3 Bg6 {It's a theory so far, this position was met before in a game of World Champions Petrosian - Smyslov, Bar 1980, the fight continued with 15.Bg6 fg 16.Ng5 Re8 17.Qh3 Nf8 18.Qb3, and then finished with a draw} 15. Ng5 Re8 {According to common understanding black has a good game. White has more space and can put pieces variously. Usually white tries to attack on a king side by attacking h7 or f4-f5 or moving h pawn forward. Black tries to organize counter play at queen c line and presses d4 pawn.} 16. f4 Bxd3 {In a game Pelletier-Deviatkin, Moscow 2003 black ad chosen 16...Rc8 and after 17.g4 f6 18.Bg6 (stronger 18.f5! ef 19.gf Ne5 20.Bb5) 18...hg 19.Nf3 Qc7 20.Qd3 Nf8 21.f5 gf 22.gf ef 23.Ne5 ef 24.Qf5, got into trouble position and lost at last} 17. Qxd3 f5 {Typical move, black is trying to close king's side, and if white takes 18.ef black 18...Nf6, pawns moved forward make squares (e4, b4) weak leading to black better position} 18. Be3 Nf8 {Debut: we have mutual pawn chain, in which black made necessary exchanges. For struggle complication white needs to promote g4, black tries to counter play on "c" line. Black has order} 19.
Kh1 {White is preparing the opening of a king side with g4} Rc8 20. g4 {Veselin is eager to fight. A good show for spectators} Qd7 {20...h6, but then 21.Ne6 Re6 22.gf Rec6 23.Rg1  and black has to worry, white has 2 pawns ready to move forward to start attacking black king} 21.

31. gxf8Q+ Bxf8 32. Qg6+ {Yes. What a mistake! White misses 33.Rg4! Bg7 34.Qc7!, cause on 34...Qf1 there is 35.Ng1.} Bg7 33. f5 {Topalov continues his attack. 33.Ng5 Re7 could lead to a draw and threat of Qe2 forces the repetition 34.Qh7 (34.f5? Qe2) 34...Kf8 35.Qg6.} Re7 34. f6 Qe2 35. Qxg4 {White attacks with all the strength 35...Rf7 36.Qh5!} Rf7 {What should black do after 36.Qh5? Black has problems with moves. If 36...Rb3, then 37.Rg7 Rg7 38.fg} 36.
Rc1 {It's a pity white has missed the second chance, now black has a hope} Rc2 {The only move} 37. Rxc2 Qd1+ 38. Kg2 Qxc2+ 39. Kg3 {What  black have to do? 39...Qe4? is not good because of  40.Qe4! de 41.Ng5 Rd7, (or 41...Bh6 42.Nf7 Be3 43.Nd8!; 41...Bf8 42.Ne6! a5 43.Ng5 and white pawn are unstoppable) 42.Ne6! for example 42... Bf8 43.Nf8 Kf8 44.e6 and pawn are stopped} Qe4 {Very natural} 40. Bf4 Qf5 {Control is passed. There is time to have some rest and think over the situation. White has missed a lot of chances. Now it needs accuracy. Endspiel after 41.Qf5 ef is dangerous for white, example: 42.fg Rg7 43.Bg5 a5, or 42.Bg5 a5!. Interesting is 41.Ng5, to be replied with 41...Rc7, and in case of 42.Ne6, answer is 2...Rc3 43.Kh4 Qh7 44.Kg5.  Amazing, black does not have draw any more} 41. Qxf5
exf5 {White needs to brake trough. Otherwise black promoting pawns will come into play. Variant 42.Ng5 Rc7 43.Ne6 Rc3 44.Kh4 Bf6 45.ef Kf7 46.Nc7! Rc6! ( worse 46...a5? 47.Kg5 a4 48.Nb5) 47.Be5 a5 48.Kg5 a4 49.Nb5 and now 49...f4! 50.Kf4 Ra6 and black gain some advantage} 42. Bg5 {What white has to do after 42.a5? It seems white has not succeeded in straight attack 3.Kf4 a4 44.Kf5 a3 45.Nd2 Rc7 and 46.e6 Bf6! 47.Bf6 Rc3!?. } a5 43. Kf4 a4 44. Kxf5 a3 45. Bc1 Bf8 46. e6 Rc7 47. Bxa3

1. d4 {Good day dear spectators! Today we have very important game. Topalov has no right to lose and he needs a victory. At this  moment he needs to get  first points, Kramnik will try to fix the success} Nf6 2. c4 e6 3. Nf3 d5 4. g3 {Catalan again. } dxc4 5. Bg2 Nc6 {Topalov continues with the rare continuation 5...Bb4.} 6. Qa4 Bd7 {6...Bb4 is more common } 7. Qxc4
Na5 8. Qd3 c5 9. O-O Bc6 10. Nc3 cxd4 11. Nxd4 Bc5 {This position was met before only once, in Tkachev - Solezhenkin, France,2000, white had chosen 12.Rd1  and after 12...Bg2 13.Qb5 Nd7 14.Kg2 a6 15.Qd3 Be7 16.Bf4 Rc8 17.Nf3 got advantage and had lead game to the victory. } 12. Rd1 {It's hard to say whether Kramnik remembers this game, but Topalov has wom 20 minutes on this move. Obviously  now preparations have finished and game begins. Now black can simplify the position by 12...Bd4 13.Qd4 Qd4 14.Rd4 Bg2 15.Kg2 Nc6 16.Rd1 0-0!? (it is attracting to to leave king in the center, but 16...Ke7  there is unpleasant 17.b3!)). White has initiative, the whle position is close to equal} Bxg2 {Risky move} 13.
Qb5+ {Right! Forcing knight to go to uncomfortable d7, where it would be overseen by rook and queen} Nd7 14. Kxg2 a6 15. Qd3 Rc8 {New. Seems to be invented at the board. 15...Nf6!? worth mentioning, preparing to castle } 16. Bg5 Be7 {Bishop cannot be taken - 16…Qg5? 17.Ne6! Qe7 18.Ng7 Kd8 19.Nd5 Qd6 20.b4 white wins } 17. Bxe7 {17.Ne4!? looks more tough, here black cannot take knight either 17…Bg5? 18.Nd6 18…Kf8 (if 18…Ke7 ?? 19.Nc8 Qc8 20.Qa3! Qc5 21.Qc5 Nc5 22.b4) 19.Nc8 Qc8 20.Nf3 attacking both  g5 and d7. Loses pawn and then castling 17…0-0? 18.Ne6 fe 19.Be7 Qe7 20.Qd7.} Qxe7 18. Rac1 {White throws the last piece into fight. Black h8 rook just dreams of a battle}
Nc4 {18…0-0 19.Ne6! leads to a losing of a pawn } 19. Na4 {Trying to prevent black forces consolidation, Nce5 with following  0-0.} b5 {Good solution, after  19…Ncb6 20.Rc8 Nc8 21.Rc1 with the idea of  Rc7, white is better} 20. b3 O-O {At last!} 21. bxc4 bxa4 22. Nc6 {Forcing the coming to a successful ending} Rxc6 23. Qxd7 {It's difficult to avoid exchange 23...Qd7 24.Rd7 and in answer to 24...Rfc8 (if 24...Rb8 then 25.Rb1!) there is nice move 25.Rb7 with the idea of Rb4. White has advantage} Qc5 {There more chance with queens } 24.
Rc3 {White professionally maneuvering with rooks. One goes t b1 then to b7, second is ready to support the attack f7 after f3} g6 25. Rb1 h5 {It's very difficult to change game flow for black, that's why opponents still make useful  } 26. Rb7 e5 {Preparing defense for the f7 pawn} 27. e4 Rf6 28. Rc2 Qa3 29. Qd1 Rd6 30.
Rd2 Rfd8 31. Rd5 Rxd5 {White has a pleasant choice} 32. cxd5 Qxa2 33. Qf3 Rf8 34. Qd3 {Defended promoting pawn in center, active position, white has advantage. Black has to develop activity, create counter play, otherwise white takes "a" pawns one by one } a3 {White has to play with attention, black has counter strike 35…f5! to natural 35.Rb3?  } 35. Rb3 f5 {White has lost all the advantage. It's possible to make a draw 36.Qa6 Qb3 37.Qg6.  }

1. d4 {Good day dear visitors! Today the dramatic game takes place. Topalov needs victory both psychologically and to improve the score. Kramnik has to resist.} d5 2. c4 c6 3. Nc3 Nf6 4. e3 {Topalov does not repeat Game 2 and does not use 4.Nf3 dc.} e6 5. Nf3 Nbd7 6. Bd3 dxc4 {Meran. Safe weapon of Kramnik in 90s which was put away for a long time and which came back this year.} 7. Bxc4
b5 8. Bd3 Bb7 9. a3 {9.0-0 is considered to be the main, 9.e4 is also popular} b4 10. Ne4 Nxe4 11. Bxe4 bxa3 12. O-O {In last games one does not spend tempo to take a pawn, thinking of taking it by bishop after b2-b3.} Bd6 13. b3
Nf6 14. Nd2 {New. In the game of Pogorelov-Vera, Spain 2006, after 4.Bd3 c5 15.dc Bc5 16.Bb5 Ke7 17.Ba3 Ba3 18.Qd8 Rfd8 19.Ra3 a6 20.Bc4 Rd6, black has got comfortable play and won. Topalov plays more actively} Qc7 15. Bf3 {!? with the price of a side pawn white does not allow black to go c6-c5. Resulting bishop at b7 falls out of fight, c6, a7 pawn become weak} Bxh2+ {Black should take 15…0-0?! 16.Nc4.} 16. Kh1 Bd6 17. Nc4 Be7 18. Bxa3 O-O 19.
Bxe7 Qxe7 20. Ra5 {Lets summarize  the debut, white sacrificed pawn for the control of (c5,e5) making it very difficult for black to make c6-c5. b7 bishop may still remain unused. White has a simple plan - to move Queen to the second line and double rooks} Rfd8 21. Kg1 {Useful move which can be wasting of time. 21.Qc2!? worth mentioning and if 21…c5, then 22.Bb7, 22…Ng4?! Can be replied by  23.Kg1, and cause 23…Qh4 is replied by 24.Rd1! and black attack is not complete} c5 {! Kramnik tries to get a pawn back, but to activate b7 bishop.

The main advantage of white is 1 extra pawn in the center at d4 controlling important squares } Rb8 27.

42. Qc2 {42.e4 fe 43.fe Qd3 44.Rd3 Bb3 could give no result} Qg5 {There are not so many variants in this position,. White is trying to make e3-e4, locating knight at  e5 is also possible with following e4. Black is likely to get white king by  h5-h4-h3.} 43. Ra1 Qf6 44.
